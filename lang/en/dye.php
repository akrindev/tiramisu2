    'info' => '** Monthly Dye ** is a feature where you can get item drop ** "⚔ weapon and 🛡 colored shield" ** by defeating Boss Monsters, on difficulty Nightmare & Ultimate Mode.  Every month on ** first date ** (1st day) "colored weapons and shields" always ** change ** or reset every ** 👾 Boss Monster **.

 In ** Nightmare Mode ** weapons & shields ❌ ** cannot be bartered (trade) **, while in ** Ultimate Mode ** weapons & shields ✔ ** can be bartered (trade) **.  So if you want to get colored weapons and shields that you can trade, choose Ultimate Mode.

 The acquisition of colored weapons ** depends on ** the weapons used by all ** your party members. ** If all your party members use different weapons, for example: 1-handed sword, 2-handed sword, staff, and katana  Then the dye (dye) you get is also a 1-Handed Sword, 2-Handed Sword, Stick, and Katana.  But if **"all members of your squad"** only use **1-handed Sword** weapons, the dye that can be obtained is also **"1-handed Sword only"**.

 So it is advisable to use different weapons so that the types of colored weapons you get are also different.

 **📔 Note:** Weapons & Shield Colors change on the first day of each month (every 1st).',
