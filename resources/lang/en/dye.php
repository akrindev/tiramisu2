    'info' => 'In Nightmare or Ultimate Mode, you have the chance to get the weapons that can be used for dyeing!

The type of weapon depends on the category of the part members’ “Main Weapons”.

If your party members (4 members including you) use “One-Handed Sword”, “One-Handed Sword”, “Staff” and “Bow”, you have the chance to get “One-Handed Sword”, “Staff”, and “Bow” To dye.

Therefore, if all the party members use “One-Handed Sword” as the main weapon, you have the chance to get only “One-Handed Sword” to dye.

The color info will change at random on the 1st day of each month
